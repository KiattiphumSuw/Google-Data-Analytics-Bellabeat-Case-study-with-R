## The insight where I found is this

The Bellabeat app has the potential to significantly contribute to the company's growth by emphasizing the importance of tracking progress for long-term healthy lifestyles, focusing on two key aspects: well exercise and quality sleep.

In terms of well exercise, it is observed that almost 75% of individuals do not achieve enough steps, despite burning around 2,000 calories. Addressing this, the app can highlight that achieving sufficient exercise may require only a small additional effort. Providing users with insights into even minor changes can serve as encouragement and motivation for more physical activity.

Regarding well sleeping, variations exist among individuals who have enough sleep. The Bellabeat app can display data on the frequency of waking up during the night and the time taken to fall asleep. This information can assist users in avoiding insomnia disorders.

As a solution, the Bellabeat app can go beyond tracking and displaying activities; it can actively motivate users. Implementing features such as a "Day Streak" system can help users build healthy lifestyle habits. This motivational approach can also be applied to sleeping behavior. Additionally, incorporating motivational quotes, short learning sessions, and instructional videos for both exercise and sleep can further enhance user engagement and encouragement.
